* Easy refactoring with rope_
* Modular requirements.in structure to be used with reqompyler_ or pip-tools_
* Auto-release to PyPI_ when you push a new tag to master (optional)
* Command line interface using Click_ (optional)

Quickstart
----------

This is the flow we reccommend for new projects.

Install the latest Cookiecutter if you haven't installed it yet (this requires
Cookiecutter 1.4.0 or higher)::

    pip install -U cookiecutter

Generate a Python package project::

    cookiecutter https://github.com/zurutech/cookiecutter-pypackage.git

Then:

* Create a GitHub repo and put it there.
* Expand on the copmatible Python versions that your package support by specifying them in
  in the ``setup.py`` file while also testing for them via Tox_ and Travis-CI_.
* Add license headers to your project using licenseheaders_.
* Add the repo to your Travis-CI_ account.
* Register_ your project with PyPI.
* Run the Travis CLI command ``travis encrypt --add deploy.password`` to encrypt your PyPI API token in Travis config
  and activate automated deployment on PyPI when you push a new tag to master branch.
* Add the repo to your ReadTheDocs_ account + turn on the ReadTheDocs service hook.
* Release your package by pushing a new tag to master.
* Activate your project on `pyup.io`_ (`pyup.io`_ is a service that helps in keeping dependencies
  fresh by automatically generating a PR whenever one of them gets a new release,
  it's free for public repos).

For more details, see the `cookiecutter-pypackage tutorial`_.


Not Exactly What You Want?
--------------------------

Don't worry, you have options:

Similar Cookiecutter Templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* `audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage`_: The One and only. This is the original ``pypackage``
  Cookiecutter. `zurutech/cookiecutter-pypackage`_ started as an internal fork of this one and became
  more opinionated over time.

* `ionelmc/cookiecutter-pylibrary`_: Cookiecutter template for a Python python library.
  Extremely configurable. `zurutech/cookiecutter-pypackage`_ is a cross between this and `audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage`_

* `Nekroze/cookiecutter-pypackage`_: A fork of this with a PyTest test runner,
  strict flake8 checking with Travis/Tox, and some docs and `setup.py` differences.

* `tony/cookiecutter-pypackage-pythonic`_: Fork with py2.7+3.3 optimizations.
  Flask/Werkzeug-style test runner, ``_compat`` module and module/doc conventions.
  See ``README.rst`` or the `github comparison view`_ for exhaustive list of
  additions and modifications.

* `ardydedase/cookiecutter-pypackage`_: A fork with separate requirements files rather
  than a requirements list in the ``setup.py`` file.

* `lgiordani/cookiecutter-pypackage`_: A fork of Cookiecutter that uses Punch_ instead of
  Bumpversion_ and with separate requirements files.

* Also see the `network`_ and `family tree`_ for this repo. (If you find
  anything that should be listed here, please add it and send a pull request!)

Fork This / Create Your Own
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have differences in your preferred setup, I encourage you to fork this
to create your own version. Or create your own; it doesn't strictly have to
be a fork.

* Once you have your own version working, add it to the Similar Cookiecutter
  Templates list above with a brief description.

* It's up to you whether or not to rename your fork/own version. Do whatever
  you think sounds good.
